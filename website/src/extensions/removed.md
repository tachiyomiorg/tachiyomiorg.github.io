# Removed sources

Generally, the following types of sources will not be added as extensions:
- Websites with significant paywalls.
- Sources that necessitate the cracking of an application's source code (as realistically, such efforts are unlikely to be undertaken).
- Sources that are known for filing numerous DMCA complaints against repositories on GitHub.

::: info NOTE
There is no specific timeframe for fulfilling source requests, bug reports, or enhancement requests, and it is uncertain whether they will be addressed.
