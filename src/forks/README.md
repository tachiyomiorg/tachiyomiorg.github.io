This hentai focused fork is based on **[TachiyomiEH](/forks/TachiyomiEH)**, it has most features and fixes from **Tachiyomi**, as well as features from **[TachiyomiJ2K](/forks/TachiyomiJ2K)**. It has decided to keep the old hamburger menu style of navigation, compared to the other forks that have moved to the new bottom navigation style.

This fork is based on [TachiyomiAZ](/forks/TachiyomiAZ) and adds quite a lot of unique features. It has the same new UI as the latest Tachiyomi version. And at the same time, it also shares quite a lot of features from both **Tachiyomi** and [TachiyomiJ2K](/forks/TachiyomiJ2K).

This fork adds features that enhances the hentai experience with integrations to popular sevices such as **E-Hentai**, **nHentai** and more.

At the moment, it is **deprecated** as the developer does not have time to maintain it. Use [TachiyomiAZ](/forks/TachiyomiAZ) or [TachiyomiSY](/forks/TachiyomiSY) instead.
