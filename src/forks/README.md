This hentai focused fork is based off of **[TachiyomiEH](/forks/TachiyomiEH)**, it has most features and fixes from **Tachiyomi**, as well as features from **[TachiyomiJ2K](/forks/TachiyomiJ2K)**. It has decided to keep the hamburger menu style of navigation, compared to the other forks that are moving to the new bottom navigation style.

This fork adds features that enhances the hentai experience with integrations to popular sevices such as **E-Hentai**, **nHentai** and more.

At the moment, it is **deprecated** as the developer does not have time to maintain it. Use [TachiyomiAZ](/forks/TachiyomiAZ) instead.
