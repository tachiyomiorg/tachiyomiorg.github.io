# Frequently Asked Questions

## Application

### Library

#### How can I see how many chapters I've downloaded?
This can be done by enabling **Download badges** under <Navigation item="library"/>.

::: guide
Enable it by going to <Navigation item="library"/> → <Navigation item="filter"/> → **Display** section and then checking the **Download badges** option at the bottom.
:::

#### Why are some covers white after restoring from backup?
The URL to the cover has probably changed. To fix this, refresh the metadata of your library.

::: guide
Refresh your metadata by going to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/> then pressing **Refresh library metadata**.
:::

#### How do I ignore chapters from certain scanlator groups?
Every now and then you find a manga that is translated by more than one group. Because of this, you get multiple releases for each chapter in the manga. The easiest way to fix this is to change sorting to **Total chapters**. You won't see any changes but, when you start reading you'll automatically skip the duplicate releases.

::: guide
Change library sorting by going to <Navigation item="library"/> → <Navigation item="filter"/> → **Sort** section then in this case selecting **Total chapters**.
:::

### Reader
#### Why are some images not displayed?
Aside from network issues, it could be because the images are too big or that the decoder doesn't support that image type.

### Downloads
#### What happened to the simultaneous downloads feature?
It was removed to prevent IP bans caused by too many requests. We know that speed is being sacrificed but it's better than not being able to access a source at all.

#### Why are Downloads unstable?
Be aware that it could be a network issue on your device or on the catalog you are trying to download from.

#### Can you make it possible to store manga on both internal storage and external SD-card?
At the moment, no. You could try using symlinks but that requires having your phone rooted.
::: aside

### Tracking
#### How do I log in with Kitsu?
To log in with Kitsu you need to use your email address as your username.

#### Why can't I find manga in MAL's search results?
You can search a manga from your MAL profile's list by searching in the following format: `my:<manga>`

:::

### Local Manga
#### How do I import my manga into Tachiyomi?
We recommend you to read [this](/help/guides/reading-local-manga) guide on how to do so.

#### What do I do if I can't find the Tachiyomi folder?
If you don't see a **Tachiyomi** folder on your device, try downloading a chapter of any manga or creating a backup so that the folder can be created.

### Application Updates
#### How do I enable automatic updates?
From version **0.9.0** and onwards, Tachiyomi has automatic updates for the app enabled by default. The **Preview** version also has automatic updates enabled by default.

However, if you think you are on an outdated version, go to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="about"/> → and click on **Check for updates**.

#### Why are automatic updates not working?

Cetain devices such as MIUI have very aggressive battery saving, which can kill the app in the background. To whitelist Tachiyomi from battery saver, go to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/> and click on **Disable battery optimization**.

### User Interface
#### Can I change the app language?
**Tachiyomi** is translated in 40+ different languages. By default, the app follows the language used on your device.
Only the UI has been localized, the language of the manga will still be using the language of the source selected.

::: guide
You can change language by going to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_general"/> then pressing **Language**.
:::

### Miscellaneous

#### Why can't I uninstall Tachiyomi?

On **Android 10**, a bug was introduced which prevented users from uninstalling the app if the phone had a MicroSD card. To fix the issue, please remove the MicroSD card from the phone first, then uninstall Tachiyomi.

#### What happened to the F-Droid version?

**F-Droid** is no longer supported. Both the Stable and Preview builds are now automatically updated. An unofficial **F-Droid** repo is available at [tachi.efreakbnc.net](https://tachi.efreakbnc.net).

#### Will there be an iOS version?
There is no iOS version and no plans for one. Since iOS and Android apps don't share code it's hard to port.

#### Will Tachiyomi ever be on the Google Play Store?
Due to Google Play's content policy, almost certainly not.

#### How can I report Tachiyomi copycats on the Google Play Store?
If you're on desktop, fill out [this](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/takedown) form following [these](https://pastebin.com/08eeuJxH) steps.
#### Can Tachiyomi read Light Novels?
No. Tachiyomi is an image parser, meaning it can't parse text.

#### Can I revert back from the Material Design 2 update of Tachiyomi?
While there will never be a toggle between the two UI versions, you can continue to use the old UI version by using [TachiyomiAZ](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/TachiyomiAZ/).

#### Will there ever be a dual-page reader option?
The logic required to make a dual-page reader automatically work along with scanlator page inconsistencies and other issues means it is unlikely to be added at this time.

#### I see manga images in my phone gallery, what gives!?
Tachiyomi by default adds a `.nomedia` file to prevent this from happening but sometimes it doesn't work or something went wrong. To fix this, all you need to do is create the file yourself. Name it `.nomedia` and place it in your download folder. 

#### I lost everything, what now?
To avoid data loss in the future, you can use the automatic backup feature.

#### Why can't I restore my backup?
To restore backups, **Tachiyomi** requires to have extensions installed for the respective manga you want to restore.


#### Why can't I find manga when searching Browse?
It might be because the title is worded differently. Follow any of the steps below:
- Look up the title on a search engine like **Google** or a manga tracking service such as [AniList](https://anilist.co/home).
- See which site has the series, often a single source will not satisfy all your needs.
- Download the extension for that source from <Navigation item="browse"/> → **Extensions** if it exists, read [this](/help/faq/#which-sources-are-in-the-multi-source-extensions) for a list of which extensions contains what sources.

#### What are some common errors?

##### `Java.lang Exception: Challenge not found`
Often this will be resolved by force-quitting and reopening **Tachiyomi**.

##### `Loader not implemented`
It means that the respective extension for the manga is not installed. To fix, install the extension for the manga. If it still doesn't work, uninstall then reinstall the extension again.

##### `Value Manga is licensed at data of type java.lang.String cannot be converted to JSONObject`

1. Press back rather than exiting the app and if that does not work, use the back arrow.

##### `App not installed`

Backup your data, uninstall the app, then restore the data in the fresh install.

##### `Attempt to invoke virtual method 'com.hippo.unifile...`
This error can be caused by a variety of reasons, all to do with storage.

::: guide
- Most commonly it is caused by full storage, check to see if your device or SD Card is full
- **Tachiyomi** doesn't have access to SD card enabled in permissions for the app
- If you're downloading and this error pops up, that means the app might not be able to access the folder you're trying to download to.
- This may be because the folder is corrupted or does not exist. Use a file manager to check that the folder(s) actually exist and every folder in the sequence is available and accessible.
- The drive you're writing to is corrupted. Check using a file manager to see if it is accessible.

:::

#### Why is MangaDex slow?
If pages are loading slowly or not at all, try:
— Making sure you have the latest version of the extension.
— Checking if MangaDex is either down, or is having the same issues.
— Trying to Clear database under More › Settings › Advanced.
— Trying to Clear chapter cache under More › Settings › Advanced.
— Going to More › Extensions › MangaDex › Image Server and then selecting a different server location.
#### Is there an alternate searching method?
**MangaDex** allows you to search using the ID number to find manga. The easiest way to get the ID is by opening the manga in your browser and looking at the URL.

:::

#### How do I deal with duplicate chapters in MangaDex?
This can be solved by opening MangaDex in <Navigation item="webview"/> and block the scanlator group whose chapter you don't want to see.

### Mangabox

#### What does `Page list is empty` mean?
**Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** have created new entries for manga on their sites again. Some old entries are obsolete and will not work. To resolve this, [migrate](/help/guides/source-migration/#source-migration) the manga from **Mangakakalot**/**Manganelo** to another source.

Open the manga in WebView and wait for the image to comes up. If the image isn't loading you will need to look elsewhere to read that particular manga, as some Mangabox sources, such as Mangakakalot, are now blocking entire regions.

You will have to open the manga entry in WebView and verify your age, as Webtoons has recently added age verifications on their site.
