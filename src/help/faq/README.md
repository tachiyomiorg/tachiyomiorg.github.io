# Frequently Asked Questions

## Application

### Library

#### How can I see how many chapters I've downloaded?
This can be done by enabling **Download badges** under <Navigation item="library"/>.

::: guide
Enable it by going to <Navigation item="library"/> → <Navigation item="filter"/> → **Display** section and then checking the **Download badges** option at the bottom.
:::

#### How do I ignore duplicate chapters?
Every now and then you find a manga that is translated by more than one group. Because of this, you get multiple releases for each chapter in the manga. There are several ways to skip the duplicate chapters:

* On the manga page, click on <Navigation item="filter"/> → **Sort** and choose **By chapter number**. This will cause the reader to skip duplicates as you read.
* Bookmark or mark as read the unwanted chapters, then click on <Navigation item="filter"/> → **Filter** and double-tap **Bookmarked** or single-tap **Unread**, respectively. This will hide any bookmarked or read chapters and skip them as you read along, as long as you have **Skip filtered chapters** enabled under <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_reader"/> → **Reading**.
* Migrate to another source that does not have duplicates. For more information on how to migrate a manga, see the [migration guide](/help/guides/source-migration/).

#### Why are some covers white after restoring from backup?
The URL to the cover has probably changed. To fix this, refresh covers in settings.

::: guide
Refresh your covers by going to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/> then pressing **Refresh library manga covers**.
:::

### Browse

#### Why can't I find a certain manga?
Sometimes you can struggle to find a source that has the manga you're looking for. Here are some tips to help you find it:
::: guide Tips to find your manga
1. Look up the manga on [Google](https://google.com/) or a manga database such as [MangaUpdates](https://www.mangaupdates.com/).
1. See if the manga has any alternate spellings or other title variations. Try searching again in your sources with the alternate titles you found.
1. If you still can't find the manga in any of your sources, then try to search for an extension for the website you've found in step 1 in the [extensions](/extensions/) list.

#### If you find the manga on a specific scanlator/aggregator and they do have an extension
Download the corresponding extension, click on it under <Navigation item="browse"/> → **Sources**, and then search for the manga there.
#### If you find the manga on a specific scanlator/aggregator and they don't have an extension
Check if adding the site as an extension has [already been requested](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues). If it hasn't been, you can [request it yourself](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues/new/choose).

If the scanlator or aggregator doesn't have an online manga reader, you can download the manga from their website and set up the series as a [local manga](/help/guides/reading-local-manga).

### Reader

#### Why are some images not displayed?
Aside from network issues, it could be because the images are too big or that the decoder doesn't support that image type.

### Downloads

#### How do I download several chapters or manga simultaneously?
The app doesn't allow parallel downloads from one source to prevent IP bans caused by too many requests. We know that speed is being sacrificed but it's better than not being able to access a source at all.

However, if you're downloading several manga from different sources, the app will start downloading simultaneously from up to 5 different sources.

#### Why do my downloads sometimes stop midway through?
Be aware that it could be a network issue on your device or on the website you are trying to download from.

#### Can you make it possible to store manga on both internal storage and external SD-card?
At the moment, no. You could try using symlinks but that requires having your device rooted.
::: note
Read more about rooting your device [here](https://www.xda-developers.com/root/)
:::

### Tracking

#### How do I log in with Kitsu?
To log in with Kitsu you need to use your email address as your username.

#### Why can't I find manga in MAL's search results?
If you can't find a manga by name, you can look it up on MAL and then search for it in Tachiyomi using the following format: `id:<id from manga URL>`. You can also search for a manga on your MAL profile list by searching in the following format: `my:<manga name>`.

### Local Manga

#### How do I import my manga into Tachiyomi?
We recommend you to read [this](/help/guides/reading-local-manga) guide on how to do so.

#### What do I do if I can't find the Tachiyomi folder?
If you don't see the **Tachiyomi** folder on your device, try setting the download location to default and downloading a chapter of any manga so that the folder can be created.

::: guide
Set download location to default by going to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_downloads"/> → **Download location** and selecting first option. Restart the app after changing download location.
:::

#### How do I fix empty/blank covers on my local manga?
Sometimes some covers for local manga aren't displayed. Follow these steps to fix it:

::: guide
1. Make sure you've created the right folder structure. To check it, open the manga with the missing cover and check if you can read chapters in the app. If not, follow [this](/help/guides/reading-local-manga) guide first.
1. Take a screenshot of which chapters you've read and then remove manga from the library.
1. Go to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/> and tap **Clear database**. This only affects manga that aren't in your library.
1. Go to <Navigation item="browse"/> → **Local source** and find the manga. The cover should be fixed now. Add the manga back to your library, mark your read chapters, and re-add tracking if needed.

### Application Updates

#### How do I enable automatic updates?
From version **0.9.0** and onwards, Tachiyomi has automatic updates for the app enabled by default. The **Preview** version also has automatic updates enabled by default.

However, if you think you are on an outdated version, go to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="about"/> and click on **Check for updates**.

#### Why are automatic updates not working?

Certain devices such as MIUI have very aggressive battery saving, which can kill the app in the background. To whitelist Tachiyomi from your battery saver, go to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/> and click on **Disable battery optimization**. If that does not work, you can also visit [DontKillMyApp](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) to see what battery saving options your device has and how to disable or circumvent them.

### User Interface

#### Can I change the app language?
**Tachiyomi** is translated into 40+ different languages. By default, the app follows the language used on your device.

::: guide
You can change language by going to <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_general"/> then pressing **Language**.
:::

### Miscellaneous

#### What is Tachiyomi Preview?
It's a weekly-updated, beta version of the app. It contains features that may be added to Tachiyomi in the future but also is more prone to bugs and crashes. Tachiyomi Preview is used by developers and contributors to test the app and find bugs.

If you are willing to use Tachiyomi Preview, be sure to [turn on auto-backup](/help/guides/creating-backups/#turning-on-auto-backups) to prevent losing your library due to potential bugs or crashes.

#### Why can't I uninstall Tachiyomi?

On **Android 10**, a bug was introduced which prevented users from uninstalling the app if the device had a MicroSD card. To fix the issue, please remove the MicroSD card from the device first, then uninstall Tachiyomi.

#### Will there be an iOS version?
There is no iOS version and there are no plans for one. Since iOS and Android apps don't share code, it's hard to port.

#### Will Tachiyomi ever be on the Google Play Store?
Due to Google Play's content policy, almost certainly not, as they do not allow the APK system to work. The content on some websites will lead to Google taking it down at some point, and Inorichi does not want to have to deal with it as they have stated [before](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi/issues/1745#issuecomment-441208074).

#### How can I report Tachiyomi copycats on the Google Play Store?
If you're on desktop, fill out [this](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/takedown) form following [these](https://pastebin.com/08eeuJxH) steps.

#### Can Tachiyomi read Light Novels?
No. Tachiyomi is an image parser, meaning it can't parse text.

#### Can I revert back from the Material Design 2 update of Tachiyomi?
While there will never be a toggle between the two UI versions, you can continue to use the old UI version by using [TachiyomiAZ](https://tachiyomi.org/forks/TachiyomiAZ/).

#### Will there ever be a dual-page reader option?
The logic required to make a dual-page reader automatically work along with scanlator page inconsistencies and other issues means it is unlikely to be added at this time.

#### Why can I see manga pages in my device's photo gallery?
Tachiyomi adds a `.nomedia` file to the downloads folder by default to prevent this from happening, but sometimes it doesn't work or something went wrong. To fix this, all you need to do is create the file yourself. Name it `.nomedia` and place it in your downloads folder. If you are having the same problem with your local manga, place the `.nomedia` file in the local folder.

#### I lost everything, what now?
To avoid data loss in the future, you can use the automatic backup feature.

::: note

:::

#### Why am I having problems restoring from my backup?
See the [guide](/help/guides/creating-backups/#restoring) on restoring from a backup.

## Extensions

### General

#### What are some recommended extensions?
Tachiyomi does not endorse or recommend any manga source, and there is no best extension. Rather, we encourage users to spend some time trying out a few sources themselves, and discover what sources work best for them. What works well for somebody else might not work well for you.

<ElAlert type="info" title="Disclaimer" description="Tachiyomi is not hosting any content, we are not affiliated with or responsible for any source that is; slow, down, missing chapters, or has subpar image quality." show-icon :closable="false"></ElAlert>

#### What are scanlator sources?
Manga that are not officially licensed are translated by scanlators, who either publish on their own website or on **MangaDex**. This is in contrast to official sources like **MANGA Plus By SHUEISHA** or **VIZ Shonen Jump**, which host officially licensed and translated manga.

Learn more about scanlation in this **Wikipedia** [**article**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanlation).

#### Which sources are in the multi-source extensions?
Some extensions contain multiple sources. Consult the [extension list](/extensions/) to find out which extension to install for the specific source that you want.

#### How do I request a new extension?
Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi-extensions/issues) if one does not already exist.

::: note
You can find the list of extensions to download [here](/extensions/)
:::

#### I'm having problems installing an extension, what can I do?
In some cases, your device might have some issues downloading and automatically installing an extension. In those cases, you can manually download and install the extension yourself. Go to the [extension list](extensions/), find the extension you want, and click **Download**. Once the .apk file has been downloaded, use your file manager to find it and open it. A prompt to install it as an app should pop up. Once it is done installing, it will be automatically added to Tachiyomi as a source.

#### How do I allow third-party installations?

:::
When installing your first extension and are prompted that your device *isn't allowed* to install unknown apps from that source, simply follow the prompt to allow it.

In *newer* versions of **Android**, you need to enable **Install unknown apps** on a per-app basis.

When installing your first extension and are prompted that your device *isn't allowed* to install unknown apps from that source, simply follow the prompt to allow it.

In *older* versions of **Android**, you only need to enable **Unknown sources** globally.

:::

#### How do I uninstall an extension?
Extensions for **Tachiyomi** are technically installed the same as normal apps. Either you uninstall them through the app section on your device's settings or do it in the app.

::: guide
To uninstall an extension from within **Tachiyomi**, go to <Navigation item="browse"/> → **Extensions** then tap **Uninstall** on the extension you want to remove.
:::

#### How can I see sources from other languages?

You do this by following the steps below:

1. Go to <Navigation item="browse"/> → **Sources**.
1. Click on <Navigation item="filter"/> on the top right corner.
1. Scroll down until you find the language of your source and enable it.

### MangaDex

#### Why are there no results when searching?
::: videolink
[<MaterialIcon icon="videocam"/> Click for video guide](/assets/faq_mangadex-no-results.mp4)
:::

If you're not getting any results when searching **MangaDex** then you need to log in. To do so enter the <Navigation item="webview"/> for **MangaDex** then press the **Manga** drop-down and choose either **Sign up** or **Log in** to proceed with the login.

::: guide
To enter the **WebView** go to <Navigation item="browse"/> → <Navigation item="button_latest"/> next to **MangaDex**, then press on <Navigation item="webview"/> in the top right corner.
:::

#### Why is MangaDex slow?
If pages are loading slowly or not at all, try:
- Making sure you have the *latest* version of the extension.
- Checking if **MangaDex** is either down, or is having the same issues.
- Trying to **Clear database** under <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/>.
- Trying to **Clear chapter cache** under <Navigation item="more"/> → <Navigation item="settings"/> → <Navigation item="settings_advanced"/>.
- Going to <Navigation item="browse"/> → <Navigation item="extensions"/> → **MangaDex** → **Image Server** and then selecting a *different* server location.

<ElAlert type="info" title="Disclaimer" description="Tachiyomi is not hosting any content, we are not affiliated with or responsible for any source that is; slow, down, missing chapters, or has subpar image quality." show-icon :closable="false"></ElAlert>

#### How do I ignore chapters from certain scanlator groups?
You can go to the manga's page in <Navigation item="webview"/> and block groups you do not want to see. Close <Navigation item="webview"/> and refresh the manga in the app. The group's chapters should be gone now.

#### Is there an alternate searching method?
**MangaDex** allows you to search using the ID number to find manga. The easiest way to get the ID is by opening the manga in your browser and looking at the URL.

::: guide
An example search would be **`id:23427`** which would return results for [Candy & Cigarettes](https://mangadex.org/title/23427/candy-cigarettes)
:::

#### How do I fix chapters from Mangaplus being broken?
Install the **MANGA Plus by SHUEISHA** extension instead and then migrate the manga that uses **MANGA Plus** on **MangaDex** onto the **MANGA Plus** source.

::: note

### Former Mangabox extensions

#### What happend to Mangabox?
As part of a general move to split up multi-source extensions, the Mangabox extension was removed, and all of its sources were made into their own extensions, namely **Mangakakalot**, **Manganelo**, **Mangabat** and **Mangairo**.

#### What do `Page list is empty` and `Source URL has changed` mean?
The former **Mangabox** extensions have created new entries for many of the manga on their websites. The old entries are obsolete and will not work. To resolve this, [migrate](/help/guides/source-migration/) the manga from the source to itself to get the new entry, or better yet, to a different source entirely to avoid similar errors in the future.

#### How do I fix the `Image could not be decoded` error?
Open the manga in <Navigation item="webview"/>, open a chapter, and wait for the images to load. If they don't load, you will need to look elsewhere to read that particular manga, as some of the former **Mangabox** sources, such as **Mangakakalot**, are now blocking entire regions.

### MangaPark

#### How do I deal with duplicate chapters in MangaPark?
To solve this issue, follow the below steps.

1. Go to <Navigation item="browse"/> → <Navigation item="extensions"/>.
1. Click on **MangaPark** extension and then **Chapter List Source**.
1. Choose an option like **Smart list** or **Prioritize source**.
1. Go back to **MangaPark**'s chapter list and refresh it.

### Webtoons

#### How do I fix the `Page list is empty` error?
You will have to open the manga entry in WebView and verify your age, as Webtoons has recently added age verifications on their website.

### KissManga and MangaRock

#### Where are Kissmanga and MangaRock?
**KissManga** went under permanently in August 2020. **MangaRock** converted from a piracy app and went legit. They are now called **INKR** but have nowhere near their old library.
