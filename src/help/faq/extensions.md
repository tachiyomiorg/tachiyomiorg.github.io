## General

### What are some good extensions?
The most popular are **MangaDex**, **MangaSee** and **Mangakakalot**, these are large sites which host content from scanlators. Description of some popular sources are listed below:

- Fastest manga updates: **Mangadex** and scanlator sources
- Largest manga library: **Mangakakalot** (found in **Mangabox** extension)
- High quality scans and official translation: **Mangasee**
- Webtoons and Manhwa/Manhua: **Toonily** (found in **Madara** extension), **Webtoons.com**, **Mangazuki.me** (also in **Madara** extension)
- Yaoi, Yuri, Shounen Ai and Shoujo Ai: **Mangahasu** (similar to Mangago.me)
- Other popular sources: **Kissmanga**, **Mangapark**, **Mangahere**, **Manhwa18.net** (in **FMReader** extension)

Most of the scanlator sources are part of **Multi-source** extensions, which contain multiple sources. For example, extensions like **Genkan**, **Madara**, **FoolSlide** and **ComiCake** which contain sources which host directly from the scanlators' own websites.

### Why won't the extensions install?
In some cases your phone might have some issues downloading the extensions, in those cases you can try installing them yourselves directly from the source.

To install just download the file for the extension you want and then install it, like how you installed **Tachiyomi**.

### How do I allow third-party installations?
When installing your first extension and are prompted that your phone isn't allowed to install unknown apps from that source, simply follow the prompt to allow it.
