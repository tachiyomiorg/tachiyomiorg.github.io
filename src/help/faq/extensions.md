## General

### What are some good extensions?

The most popular are MangaDex, MangaRock and MangaSee, these are large
sites which host content from scanlators, there's also extensions like
Genkan, Madara, FoolSlide and ComiCake which contain sources which
host directly from the scanlators own websites.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TyJEUg78WWH4zgnf3g6M2lkbWpBWbd40FYiPVQhW8IU/edit#gid=0)
is a good spreadsheet showing the different extensions and their sources.

### Why won't the extensions install?

In some cases your phone might have some issues downloading the
extensions, in those cases you can try installing them yourselves
directly from the source. [Here](https://github.com/inorichi/tachiyomi-extensions/tree/repo/apk)
is the repository for the files.

To install just download the `.apk` file for the extension you want
and then install it, like how you installed Tachiyomi.

### How do I allow third-party installations?

When installing your first extension and are prompted that your phone
isn't allowed to install unknown apps from that source, simply press
the `Settings` button and then allow it.

Two example videos, left one is for newer Androids.

<figure class="centered">
	<video autoplay crossorigin="use-credentials" height="355"
	  intrinsicsize="400x688" loading="lazy" loop="loop" muted="muted"
	  playsinline="playsinline" :poster="$withBase('/assets/media/unknownapps-api28.png')"
	  preload="none" width="200">
		<source :src="$withBase('/assets/media/unknownapps-api28.webm')" type="video/webm" />
		<source :src="$withBase('/assets/media/unknownapps-api28.mp4')" type="video/mp4" />
	</video>
	<video autoplay crossorigin="use-credentials" height="355"
	  intrinsicsize="400x688" loading="lazy" loop="loop" muted="muted"
	  playsinline="playsinline" :poster="$withBase('/assets/media/unknownapps-api25.png')"
	  preload="none" width="200">
		<source :src="$withBase('/assets/media/unknownapps-api25.webm')" type="video/webm" />
		<source :src="$withBase('/assets/media/unknownapps-api25.mp4')" type="video/mp4" />
	</video>
</figure>

### How do I uninstall an extension?

Extensions for Tachiyomi are technically installed the same as normal apps.
Either you uninstall them through the place you normally uninstall apps or
you go to the `Extensions` tab, enter the extension you wish to uninstall
then press `Uninstall`.

### Why don't I have extensions or any sources in the catalog?

**A:** `Tachiyomi 0.8.4` and above no longer have pre-installed extensions,
so when upgrading or installing versions above this, installing the extensions
you use will be required to install extensions from the extensions menu
(the one with the puzzle piece).

**B:** If you're getting a "Loader not implemented" error after clicking on a manga, you will need to reinstall the extensions you used to use. Which number in the menu corresponds to which is below.

::: warning
Be aware that Batoto is deprecated so you will need to migrate from that source to others.

### Error: java.lang Exception: Challenge not found

Try closing (force-quit) and reopening Tachiyomi.

## MangaDex

### No results when searching

::: tip
Make sure you're on app version `0.8.4` or higher.
:::

If you're not getting any results when searching MangaDex then you need to log in.

To do so, go to `Browse`/`Latest` for MangaDex under `Catalogues`, open any manga from the list and then press the overflow menu (3 dot menu) in the top-right corner and then the `Open in web view` button.

Now go to the hamburger menu, press the `Manga` drop-down and then choose either `Sign up` or `Log in` to proceed with the log in.

### Alternate searching method

In `Mangadex 1.2.52` and newer the extension allows you to search using the id number to find manga. To get the id number look at the URL of the manga you want to add.

An example search: `id:31477`.

### Chapters from Mangaplus are broken

Install the Mangaplus extension and then migrate the manga that uses Mangaplus on Mangadex onto the Mangaplus source.

## MangaRock

#### Regarding MangaRock going away:

- You won't lose existing bookmarks or downloads.
- Chapters will no longer be updated once MangaRock is dead.
- There is no native way to automatically import your favorites from MangaRock (although you can try [waicool20/mr2tachiyomi](https://github.com/waicool20/mr2tachiyomi)).
- Popular alternatives: Mangasee, Kissmanga, MangaDex, Mangakakalot, Toonily.

#### Migrate to Tachiyomi

There is a tool to migrate from MangaRock to Tachiyomi courtesy of a member of our Discord server by the same name as the creator, but a computer is required to finish the migration successfully.

Note that you must download the 64-bit version of Java or it will run out of memory. Access the program at [waicool20/mr2tachiyomi](https://github.com/waicool20/mr2tachiyomi).

## Madara

### Leviatan Scans is missing

Leviatan Scans has shifted from Madara to Genkan extension.

Install Genkan. Migrate all Leviatan scans. Update Madara.

## KissManga

### Error: Page list is empty

If you get this error then you need to solve the captcha on their website using your browser (*Google Chrome*, *Samsung Browser*, *Firefox*, *Opera*, etc.).
