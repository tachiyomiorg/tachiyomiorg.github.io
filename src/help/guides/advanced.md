# Advanced
The features in this section mostly relates to keeping entries up to date or clearing unnecessary things from the app.

:construction: :construction_worker_man: W.I.P. Description, help us improve through [here](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/website/edit/master/src/help/guides/advanced.md)!

## Clear chapter cache
This setting clears the cache of images from the app. Tachiyomi autoclears the cache when it reaches a certain threshold.

## Clear cookies

This setting clears all cookies from Tachiyomi and the webview browser. This may log you out of tracking services and other parts of the app that use cookies to login to the site, such as MangaDex.

## Clear database

This removes entries of manga that are not in the library. This is useful for solving any problems in a extension that have been fixed but have not been updated in the app yet. 

## Refresh library metadata

This setting refreshes all aspects of entries in the library to the most recent one that can be found from the source it's from. It updates the cover, grene, description, and the complete status of the entry.

## Refresh tracking metadata

This setting refreshes all tracking info to the most recent version that can be found on the tracking service, such as completed status, rating, and the last chapter read number.
