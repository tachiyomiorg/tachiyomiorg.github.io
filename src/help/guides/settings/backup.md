# Backup
This category of settings allows you to setup a backup and restore mechanism for the manga you are reading in the app.


## Create backup
Create backup lets you backup your library (titles, categories, read chapters), tracking settings, and reading history. This setting will bring up a dialog letting you choose what to backup. Manga is greyed out because it will always be backed up.
