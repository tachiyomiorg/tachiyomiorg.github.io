# Tracking 
This feature allows you to record the progress of chapters read in the app once you've linked an account and a manga to the service. You may currently use and track using five services in-app: MyAnimeList, Anilist, Kitsu, Shikimori, and Bangumi. 

To login to each service, tap on the service you want to use, then complete the login feature from there and press login. Once done with that, press the back button if necessary.
		
Linking an account doesn't automatically start syncing, so you'll have to link manga for each title manually. To do this, go to the manga entry, swipe to the tracking tab, and press the edit button. It'll automatically search the manga title then you'll have to tap on the title you think is right then press ok. After this, you can set a rating or a chapter read if wanted.


## Sync chapters after reading <Badge text="True" type="default-indicator" vertical="middle"/>
This setting automatically updates the latest chapter read once you reach the last page of a chapter.
