# Tracking

This feature allows you to record progress of chapters read in the app once you've linked a account and the manga to the service. You may use and track using ? Currently five services are available for use inapp: MyAnimeList, Anilist, Kitsu, Shikimori, and Bangumi. 

To login to each service, tap on the service you want to use, then complete the login feature from there and press login. Once you're done with that, press the back button if necessary.

Linking a account doesn't automatically start syncing, so you'll have to manually link manga for each title. To do this, go to the manga entry, swipe to the tracking tab, and press the edit button. It'll automatically search the manga title then you'll have to tap on the title you think is right then press ok. After this, you can set a rating or a chapter read if wanted.
