# General
General settings page for Tachiyomi, help us improve through [here](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/website/edit/master/src/help/guides/general.md)!

## Language

Changes the app language. There are 35 languages to choose from, alognside the default system language. The instruction to change language can be found [here](../faq/application.html#how-do-i-change-the-app-language). 

## Application theme

By default, Tachiyomi is in light mode. To change the theme to dark mode, go to `Settings` -> `General` -> `Application theme`. There are four options, `Main theme` (light), `Dark theme`, `AMOLED theme` and `Dark blue`. AMOLED theme is pure black. 

## Library manga per row

Bookmarked manga in `My Library` can be categorized by manga per row for easier navigation, so that the thumbnails do not take up too much space. `Portrait` refers to the number of columns available in portrait mode, and `Landscape` refers to number of columns in landscape mode. Tachiyomi can be set to desired rotation orientation in [Rotation](../guides/reader.html#rotation) under `Reader`.

## Start screen

This refers to what page the app starts on, which are `My library`, `Recently read` and `Library updates`.

## Library update frequency

This prompts Tachiyomi to automatically check for chapter update for bookmarked manga in `My library`, according to the desired frequency. It can set to `Manual` or up to 2 days. To manually check for chapter update, go to `Library updates`, then drag down screen and release. 

## Library update restrictions

Library update check can be set under restricted conditions, ie. when the phone's only on Wi-fi, charging or both. 

## Only update ongoing manga

Manga which have `Ongoing` tag on their `Info` page are updated only.

## Categories to include in global update

If checked, only bookmarks in selected user made Categories will be prompted to check for chapter updates.

## Library update order

The app checks for manga updates in their alphabetical order, or when they were last updated.

## Default category

Sets default category for bookmarks to be added to `My library`. `Always ask` will prompt the user to put newly added bookmark in their desired category. Otherwise, user can put their bookmark into a category of choice.
