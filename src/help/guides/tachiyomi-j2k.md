### Feature list:
Here are the exclusive features on J2K fork that is not found on the Stable version. 
- Improved notifications: 
  - New chapter notifications: Notifications for new chapters are grouped together, expanding it shows information about the new chapters (chapter name and manga  cover). Tapping on it will open the chapter, or expand it to mark it as read or view all chapters.
  - Notification for extension updates: Checks every hour while using the app, and every 12 hour in the background.
  - Notification separation of library updates and new chapters.
- Batch Auto-Source Migration: Can migrate all manga from a single source to another source.
- Improved backup: Backup restore no longer starts over from the beginning if it's stopped, all manga that's shown on the progress bar are restored.
- Removing favorites auto deletes downloaded chapters, and can be reversed with `Undo` button if removed by accident.
- Library tag search: Filter manga in `My library` by searching for tags (ex. "Comedy", "Slice of Life") or exclude mangas by a tag (ex. "-Shounen"). Tapping on these tags also performs a local search. You can also sort manga by source by searching for the source name (ex. Mangakakalot).
- Negative filters in `My library`.
- Range Select (for `My library` and `Chapter list`): Long press an item then long press on another to select everything in between.
- Drag & Drop sorting: Long press a manga and drag the thumbnail around to manually sort manga in `My library`. This also works alongside other sorting (such as `Last read`).
- Improved downloads: Manga in `Downloads queue` can now be reordered or cancelled.
- Edit manga info: Title, tags, description, cover image etc can be manually edited for manga in `My library` (click the Pencil icon on `INFO` tab to edit).
- Filter extension by locale: Only extensions matching the sytem language will appear on `Extensions` menu by default (ie. if English is the system language, only All and English language extensions would appear by default).
- Unlimited reading history for `Recently read`.
- Search/sorting/mass enable/disable options for `Sources` menu in `Catalogues`.
- Webview Navigation
- Clicking on manga thumbnail on `INFO` page now shows an enlarged preview.
- Changelog for app update can be found by going to `Settings` > `About` and clicking on `Build time`.
- Automatic background based on manga page: For those that like having a white background to match the content, this will automatically set the background to match for moments such as a flashback section of a manga.
- Fingerprint/Biometrics lock.
- Option to hide manga titles in grid view.
- Android 10 features:
  - System dark Theme support: You can have Tachiyomi follow the system theme as well as custom dark themes.
  - Edge to edge support (and a translucent nav bar for older versions): no more small ugly bar for the gesture navigation
  - Share sheets upgrade 
  - Reader seekbar overrides switch app gesture, so no more accidents for that.
