# Tachiyomi Website Contributing Guide

Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [Development Setup](#development-setup)
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)
- [Images and Videos guidelines](#images-and-videos-guidelines)

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **version 12+**, and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm) **version 7+**.

After cloning the repo, run:

``` bash
# Installs any dependencies needed.
$ npm install
```

To run the project now, run:

``` bash
# This command start a local server you can access and edit live.
$ npm run serve
```

### Commonly used NPM scripts

``` bash
# This command will generate a static site inside a public directory in your project.
$ npm run build

# This command will lint your files.
$ npm run lint
```

 **Please make sure to have `npm run build` pass successfully before submitting a PR.** Although the same tests will be run against your PR on the CI server, it is better to have it working locally.
